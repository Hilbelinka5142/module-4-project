# module4project

A couple challenges that I had while making this project is connecting it to vercel, and being able to actually use that program I had a lot of problems.  Something That I learned going through this is that there
are a lot of things that you are able to do with json and phython and just the ability to connect so many different things together through vercel or github or something similar

A backlog That was created was just talking about how there could be more improvment in the UI of the program when you run it

the reason that I think I would be seeing a different IP when doing it locally compared to when doing it through vercel.  Is because of when doing it locally I am getting the local private IP address, while going
through vercel which is coming from its own network it would see the public IP address that I am using
